Welcome to my personal page! I am Simeon Manolov, a software developer
currently on a journey into the world of artificial intelligence (AI).

I have a solid background in backend development within the Fintech domain and
I've honed my skills in multiple programming languages. Sometime around the
summer of 2023, my passion for AI and Machine Learning grew strong
enough and I eventually decided to quit my job and dedicate 100% of my time on
the subject, which is all I've been busying myself with since.

My fascination with AI extends beyond mere interest; it's a driving force that
has led me to invest significant time and effort in personal ML projects and
start looking for ways to grow professionally.

Combining two areas of interest - gaming and AI - is a great way to leverage my
programming skills and invest my time into something that really lights a
spark. My gaming days are in a time long past now, but creating environments
where I can use Reinforcement Learning techniques to train my own AI agents
to play games is a great way for me to embark on my journey into this new world.

I have always loved working on "pet" projects. Projects are important - they
represent a complete cycle which starts with identifying a problem, coming up
with a solution, then getting my hands dirty and _actually doing it_.
And last, but not least - they make the engineer in me proud. In the
past those were projects for audio devices that I used for gigs with my
band (that is, back when I was still playing in one... RIP <a

target="_blank">Cupola</a> ‚ô°). After that, it was devices for home automation.
Now it's - well, you know already - AI, but this time I want to develop
profesionally in the field. This time, _I'm game_.

My plan for the future is to find a team of like-minded AI professionals which
I can learn from, share ideas with and where I can grow as an expert in the
field. In 10 years, I imagine myself capable of creating all sorts of
AI-powered systems with superhuman capabilities. Similar to my personal
projects where my AI agents become really good at playing the game, but 
beyond the games - something that truly matters for humanity.
