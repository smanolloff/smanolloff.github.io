Welcome to my personal page! I am Simeon Manolov, a software developer
currently on a journey into the world of artificial intelligence (AI).

I have a solid background in backend development within the Fintech domain and
I've honed my skills in multiple programming languages. Sometime around the
summer of 2023, my passion for AI and Reinforcement Learning grew strong
enough and I eventually decided to quit my job and dedicate 100% of my time on
the subject, which is all I've been busying myself with since.

My fascination with AI extends beyond mere interest; it's a driving force that
has led me to invest significant time and effort in personal projects related
to Reinforcement Learning.

Combining two areas of interest - gaming and AI - is a great way to leverage my
programming skills and invest my time into something that really lights a
spark. My gaming days are in a time long past now, but creating environments
where I can use Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to train my own AI
agents to play games... that is something else. It feels _good_, and is a
great way to start my journey into the new world.

I have always loved working on "pet" projects. Projects are important - they
represent a complete cycle in which I identify a problem, come up with a
solution, then getting my hands dirty and _actually doing it_.
And last, but not least - they make the engineer in me proud. In the
past those were projects for audio devices that I used for gigs with my
band (that is, back when I was still playing in one... RIP <a

target="_blank">Cupola</a> ‚ô°). Then, it was devices for home automation.
Now it's - well, you know already - AI.

My plan for the future is to find a team of like-minded AI professionals which
I can learn from, share ideas with and where I can grow as an expert in the
field. In 10 years, I imagine myself capable of creating all sorts of
AI-powered systems with superhuman capabilities that make you go "whoa, that's
really _something_". Just like now, with those games and my
AI agents which become ridiculously good at playing them, better than me or any
human being. But beyond the games. Something big, something that truly matters.
Ideally - spaceships :)
